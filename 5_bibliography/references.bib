	abstract = {Since 1995, more than 500 exoplanets have been detected using different techniques, of which 11 were detected with gravitational microlensing. Most of these are gravitationally bound to their host stars. There is some evidence of free-floating planetary mass objects in young star-forming regions, but these objects are limited to massive objects of 3 to 15 Jupiter masses with large uncertainties in photometric mass estimates and their abundance. Here, we report the discovery of a population of unbound or distant Jupiter-mass objects, which are almost twice (1.8\_\{-0.8\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.7\}) as common as main-sequence stars, based on two years of gravitational microlensing survey observations toward the Galactic Bulge. These planetary-mass objects have no host stars that can be detected within about ten astronomical units by gravitational microlensing. However a comparison with constraints from direct imaging suggests that most of these planetary-mass objects are not bound to any host star. An abrupt change in the mass function at about a Jupiter mass favours the idea that their formation process is different from that of stars and brown dwarfs. They may have formed in proto-planetary disks and subsequently scattered into unbound or very distant orbits.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract  Weak gravitational lensing provides a unique method to map directly the distribution of dark matter in the universe and to measure cosmological parameters. This cosmic-shear technique is based on the measurement of the weak distortions that lensing induces in the shape of background galaxies as photons travel through large-scale structures. This technique is now widely used to measure the mass distribution of galaxy clusters and has recently been detected in random regions of the sky. In this review, we present the theory and observational status of cosmic shear. We describe the principles of weak lensing and the predictions for the shear statistics in favored cosmological models. Next, we review the current measurements of cosmic shear and show how they constrain cosmological parameters. We then describe the prospects offered by upcoming and future cosmic-shear surveys as well as the technical challenges that have to be met for the promises of cosmic shear to be fully realized.},

            Next-generation large sky surveys will observe up to billions of galaxies for which basic structural parameters are needed to study their evolution. This is a challenging task that, for ground-based observations, is complicated by seeing-limited point-spread functions (PSFs). To perform a fast and accurate analysis of galaxy surface brightness, we have developed a family of supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to derive Sérsic profile parameters of galaxies. This work presents the first two Galaxy Light profile CNNs (GaLNets) of this family. The first one is trained using galaxy images only (GaLNet-1), and the second is trained with both galaxy images and the local PSF (GaLNet-2). We have compared the results from GaLNets with structural parameters (total magnitude, effective radius, Sérsic index, etc.) derived from a set of galaxies from the Kilo-Degree Survey by 2DPHOT as a representative of the “standard” PSF-convolved Sérsic fitting tools. The comparison shows that GaLNet-2 can reach an accuracy as high as that of 2DPHOT, while GaLNet-1 performs worse because it misses the information from the local PSF. Both GaLNets are three orders of magnitude faster than standard methods in terms of computational speed. This first application of CNNs to ground-based galaxy surface photometry shows that they are promising tools to perform parametric analyses of very large galaxy samples, like the ones expected from the Vera Rubin/LSST surveys. However, GaLNets can be easily modified for space observations from Euclid and the China Space Station Telescope.},

            The effects of seeing on the parameters of the Sèrsic profile are studied in an analytical form using a Gaussian point spread function. The surface brightness of Sèrsic profiles is proportional (in magnitudes) to r1/n. The parameter n serves to classify the type of profile and is related to the central luminosity concentration. It is the parameter most affected by seeing; furthermore, the value of n that can be measured is always smaller than the real one. It is shown that the luminosity density of the Sèrsic profile with n less than 0.5 has a central depression, which is physically unlikely. Also, the intrinsic ellipticity of the sources has been taken into account and we show that the parameters are dependent when the effects of seeing are non-negligible. Finally, a prescription for correcting raw effective radii, central intensities and n parameters is given.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Strong lensing provides a powerful means of investigating the nature of dark matter as it probes dark matter structure on sub-galactic scales. We present an extension of a forward modelling framework that uses flux ratios from quadruply imaged quasars (quads) to measure the shape and amplitude of the halo mass function, including line-of-sight (LOS) haloes and main deflector subhaloes. We apply this machinery to 50 mock lenses – roughly the number of known quads – with warm dark matter (WDM) mass functions exhibiting free-streaming cut-offs parametrized by the half-mode mass mhm. Assuming cold dark matter (CDM), we forecast bounds on mhm and the corresponding thermal relic particle masses over a range of tidal destruction severity, assuming a particular WDM mass function and mass–concentration relation. With significant tidal destruction, at 2σ we constrain \$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm \{hm\}\}{\textbackslash}lt 10{\textasciicircum}\{7.9\} {\textbackslash}left(10{\textasciicircum}\{8.4\}{\textbackslash}right) {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, or a 4.4 (3.1) keV thermal relic, with image flux uncertainties from measurements and lens modelling of \$2\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\} {\textbackslash}left(6\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}{\textbackslash}right)\$. With less severe tidal destruction we constrain \$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm \{hm\}\}{\textbackslash}lt 10{\textasciicircum}\{7\} {\textbackslash}left(10{\textasciicircum}\{7.4\}{\textbackslash}right) {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, or an 8.2 (6.2) keV thermal relic. If dark matter is warm, with \$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm \{hm\}\} = 10{\textasciicircum}\{7.7\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ (5.1 keV), we would favour WDM with \$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm \{hm\}\} {\textbackslash}gt 10{\textasciicircum}\{7.7\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ over CDM with relative likelihoods of 22:1 and 8:1 with flux uncertainties of \$2\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ and \$6\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$, respectively. These bounds improve over those obtained by modelling only main deflector subhaloes because LOS objects produce additional flux perturbations, especially for high-redshift systems. These results indicate that ∼50 quads can conclusively differentiate between WDM and CDM.},

	abstract = {The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is one of the most ubiquitous tools in statistical modeling. The first model selection criterion to gain widespread acceptance, AIC was introduced in 1973 by Hirotugu Akaike as an extension to the maximum likelihood principle. Maximum likelihood is conventionally applied to estimate the parameters of a model once the structure and dimension of the model have been formulated. Akaike's seminal idea was to combine into a single procedure the process of estimation with structural and dimensional determination. This article reviews the conceptual and theoretical foundations for AIC, discusses its properties and its predictive interpretation, and provides a synopsis of important practical issues pertinent to its application. Comparisons and delineations are drawn between AIC and its primary competitor, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). In addition, the article covers refinements of AIC for settings where the asymptotic conditions and model specification assumptions that underlie the justification of AIC may be violated.

This article provides a basic introduction to MCMC methods by establishing a strong conceptual understanding of what problems MCMC methods are trying to solve, why we want to use them, and how they work in theory and in practice. To develop these concepts, I outline the foundations of Bayesian inference, discuss how posterior distributions are used in practice, explore basic approaches to estimate posterior-based quantities, and derive their link to Monte Carlo sampling and MCMC. Using a simple toy problem, I then demonstrate how these concepts can be used to understand the benefits and drawbacks of various MCMC approaches. Exercises designed to highlight various concepts are also included throughout the article.},

	abstract = {In order to use a gravitational lens to measure the Hubble constant accurately, it is necessary to derive a reliable model of the lens surface potential. If the analysis is restricted to the locations and magnifications of point images, the derived Hubble constant depends upon the class of mass models used to fit the data. However, when there is extended emission from an Einstein ring, it may be possible to derive a potential from the observed surface brightness in a model-independent manner. This procedure is illustrated with reference to B1608+656. The multi-band images are de-reddened, de-convolved and de-contaminated so that the luminous matter and the surface brightness contours in the Einstein ring are both faithfully mapped. This intensity distribution can then be used to reconstruct the potential. Progress in implementing this program is reported. The observed incidence of multiple-imaged galaxies on the Hubble Deep Fields is an order of magnitude smaller than naively predicted on the basis of radio lens surveys, like CLASS, but consistent with the rate computed using surface photometry of candidate lens galaxies assuming standard mass to light ratios. In order to resolve this paradox, it is suggested that most galaxy lenses are located in compact groups.},

Stellar systems that follow the R exp 1/m law are assumed to have constant mass-to-light ratios and to be spherically symmetrical and isotropic in terms of the velocity dispersion tensor. Calculations are presented of the assumed surface-brightness profile, the spatial luminosity and density, and the line-of-sight velocity dispersion for values of m ranging from 2 to 10. The dimensionless distribution function and the normalized differential energy distribution (DED) are developed and given. The results show that the distribution function is never negative for the systems, and the exponential behavior of the DED is a common property of these stellar systems. The fraction of stellar mass within the Boltzmann range is found to depend on the parameter m and relate to the Vaucouleurs law maximum (m = 4).},

              Current efforts in observational cosmology are focused on characterizing the mass-energy content of the universe. We present results from a geometric test based on strong lensing in galaxy clusters. Based on Hubble Space Telescope images and extensive ground-based spectroscopic follow-up of the massive galaxy cluster Abell 1689, we used a parametric model to simultaneously constrain the cluster mass distribution and dark energy equation of state.

	abstract = {We present lenstronomy, a multi-purpose open-source gravitational lens modelling pythonpackage. lenstronomy is able to reconstruct the lens mass and surface brightness distributions of strong lensing systems using forward modelling. lenstronomy supports a wide range of analytic lens and light models in arbitrary combination. The software is also able to reconstruct complex extended sources (Birrer et. al 2015) as well as being able to model point sources. We designed lenstronomy to be stable, flexible and numerically accurate, with a clear user interface that could be deployed across different platforms. Throughout its development, we have actively used lenstronomy to make several measurements including deriving constraints on dark matter properties in strong lenses, measuring the expansion history of the universe with time-delay cosmography, measuring cosmic shear with Einstein rings and decomposing quasar and host galaxy light. The software is distributed under the MIT license. The documentation, starter guide, example notebooks, source code and installation guidelines can be found at https://lenstronomy.readthedocs.io.},

	abstract = {End-to-end trained neural networks (NNs) are a compelling approach to autonomous vehicle control because of their ability to learn complex tasks without manual engineering of rule-based decisions. However, challenging road conditions, ambiguous navigation situations, and safety considerations require reliable uncertainty estimation for the eventual adoption of full-scale autonomous vehicles. Bayesian deep learning approaches provide a way to estimate uncertainty by approximating the posterior distribution of weights given a set of training data. Dropout training in deep NNs approximates Bayesian inference in a deep Gaussian process and can thus be used to estimate model uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian NN for end-to-end control that estimates uncertainty by exploiting feature map correlation during training. This approach achieves improved model fits, as well as tighter uncertainty estimates, than traditional element-wise dropout. We evaluate our algorithms on a challenging dataset collected over many different road types, times of day, and weather conditions, and demonstrate how uncertainties can be used in conjunction with a human controller in a parallel autonomous setting.},

We propose a method to automatically adjust multiple learning rates so as to minimize the expected error at any one time. The method relies on local gradient variations across samples. In our approach, learning rates can increase as well as decrease, making it suitable for non-stationary problems. Using a number of convex and non-convex learning tasks, we show that the resulting algorithm matches the performance of the best settings obtained through systematic search, and effectively removes the need for learning rate tuning.},

As a result of the weight adjustments, internal ‘hidden’ units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.},

In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance.

AD does not incur any truncation error and would yield exact results if the calculations were done in real arithmetic; in other words the derivatives obtained are accurate to machine precision. In this tutorial we uncover the details of the AD technology, presenting them in a simple manner. We present basics of AD and its complexity followed by some examples.},

	abstract = {For 100 years since galaxies were found to be flying apart from each other, astronomers have been trying to determine how fast. The expansion, characterized by the Hubble constant, H0, is confused locally by peculiar velocities caused by gravitational interactions, so observers must obtain accurate distances at significant redshifts. Very nearby in our Galaxy, accurate distances can be determined through stellar parallaxes. There is no good method for obtaining galaxy distances that is applicable from the near domain of stellar parallaxes to the far domain free from velocity anomalies. The recourse is the distance ladder involving multiple methods with overlapping domains. Good progress is being made on this project, with satisfactory procedures and linkages identified and tested across the necessary distance range. Best values of H0 from the distance ladder lie in the range 73 - 75 km/s/Mpc. On the other hand, from detailed information available from the power spectrum of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, coupled with constraints favoring the existence of dark energy from distant supernova measurements, there is the precise prediction that H0 = 67.4 to 1\%. If it is conclusively determined that the Hubble constant is well above 70 km/s/Mpc as indicated by distance ladder results then the current preferred LambdaCDM cosmological model based on the Standard Model of particle physics may be incomplete. There is reason for optimism that the value of the Hubble constant from distance ladder observations will be rigorously defined with 1\% accuracy in the near future.},

	abstract = {We present a parametric strong lensing model of the cluster Abell 2218 based on HST ACS data. We constrain the lens model using 8 previously known multiply imaged systems, of which 7 have spectroscopically confirmed redshifts. In addition, we propose five candidate multiply imaged systems and estimate their redshifts using our mass model. The model parameters are optimized in the source plane by a bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain as implemented in the the publicly available software Lenstool. We find rms=0."12 for the scatter of the sources in the source plane, which translates into rms=1."49 between the predicted and measured image positions in the image plane. We find that the projected mass distribution of Abell 2218 is bimodal, which is supported by an analysis of the light distribution. We also find evidence for two structures in velocity space, separated by {\textasciitilde}1000 km/s, corresponding to the two large scale dark matter clumps. We find that the lensing constraints can not be well reproduced using only dark matter halos associated with the cluster galaxies, but that the dark matter is required to be smoothly distributed in large scale halos. At 100" the enclosed projected mass is 3.8e14 solar masses. At that radius, the large scale halos contribute {\textasciitilde}85\% of the mass. We find that the model is not very sensitive to the fainter galaxy sized halos, unless they locally perturb a given multiply imaged system. Therefore, dark galaxy sized substructure can be reliably constrained only if it locally perturbs one of the systems. In an appendix we give a self-contained description of the parametric profile we use, the dual pseudo isothermal elliptical mass distribution (dPIE). This profile is a two component pseudo isothermal mass distribution (PIEMD) with both a core radii and a scale radii. (Abridged)},

            Since upcoming telescopes will observe thousands of strong lensing systems, creating fully automated analysis pipelines for these images becomes increasingly important. In this work, we make a step towards that direction by developing the first end-to-end differentiable strong lensing pipeline. Our approach leverages and combines three important computer science developments: (i) convolutional neural networks (CNNs), (ii) efficient gradient-based sampling techniques, and (iii) deep probabilistic programming languages. The latter automatize parameter inference and enable the combination of generative deep neural networks and physics components in a single model. In the current work, we demonstrate that it is possible to combine a CNN trained on galaxy images as a source model with a fully differentiable and exact implementation of gravitational lensing physics in a single probabilistic model. This does away with hyperparameter tuning for the source model, enables the simultaneous optimization of nearly 100 source and lens parameters with gradient-based methods, and allows the use of efficient gradient-based posterior sampling techniques. These features make this automated inference pipeline potentially suitable for processing a large amount of data. By analysing mock lensing systems with different signal-to-noise ratios, we show that lensing parameters are reconstructed with per cent-level accuracy. More generally, we consider this work as one of the first steps in establishing differentiable probabilistic programming techniques in the particle astrophysics community, which have the potential to significantly accelerate and improve many complex data analysis tasks.},

	title = {Large {Scale} {Distributed} {Deep} {Networks}},
	abstract = {Recent work in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning has shown that being able to train large models can dramatically improve performance. In this paper, we consider the problem of training a deep network with billions of parameters using tens of thousands of CPU cores. We have developed a software framework called DistBelief that can utilize computing clusters with thousands of machines to train large models. Within this framework, we have developed two algorithms for large-scale distributed training: (i) Downpour SGD, an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent procedure supporting a large number of model replicas, and (ii) Sandblaster, a framework that supports a variety of distributed batch optimization procedures, including a distributed implementation of L-BFGS. Downpour SGD and Sandblaster L-BFGS both increase the scale and speed of deep network training. We have successfully used our system to train a deep network 30x larger than previously reported in the literature, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, a visual object recognition task with 16 million images and 21k categories. We show that these same techniques dramatically accelerate the training of a more modestly- sized deep network for a commercial speech recognition service. Although we focus on and report performance of these methods as applied to training large neural networks, the underlying algorithms are applicable to any gradient-based machine learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {We present theoretical models of a dwarf galaxy that has been hypothesized to be a gravitational lens for the quasi-stellar object (QSO, or quasar) J091949.16+342304.0. This lens system is notable for containing multiple quasar images as well as a faint, but detectable, Einstein ring. The observed images require a gravitational lens with a conservative mass estimate of ≈ 2.5 × 1011M⊙, but there is no corresponding detection of a high-mass galaxy, which would normally be expected for such a massive lens. We calculate the dwarf galaxy mass to be 4.2 × 109M⊙, for a baryonic mass ratio of 1.68\%. We begin our report by discussing the underlying principles of gravitational lensing, then apply them to different lens models. We initially consider the lens as a point mass, then as a spherical singular isothermal sphere (SIS), then progress to spherical and elliptical softened SIS models. We also explain the analytical and numerical methods that we developed to compute these models. Using an elliptical softened singular isothermal sphere model, we find a best fit to the data by using a lens with an eccentricity e= 0.22 and an isotropic velocity dispersion of σv = 375 km/s. We also investigate the implications of this model, in particular the lens’ mass distribution and rotational velocity curves, as well as potential explanations for the occurrence of this unique system.},

A key concern is the efficiency of evaluating the expressions and their derivatives that hinges on the representation of these expressions. Recently, an algorithm for computing higher order derivatives of tensor expressions like Jacobians or Hessians has been introduced that is a few orders of magnitude faster than previous state-of-the-art approaches. Unfortunately, the approach is based on Ricci notation and hence cannot be incorporated into automatic differentiation frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, autograd, or JAX that use the simpler Einstein notation. This leaves two options, to either change the underlying tensor representation in these frameworks or to develop a new, provably correct algorithm based on Einstein notation. Obviously, the first option is impractical. Hence, we pursue the second option. Here, we show that using Ricci notation is not necessary for an efficient tensor calculus and develop an equally efficient method for the simpler Einstein notation. It turns out that turning to Einstein notation enables further improvements that lead to even better efficiency.},

Tests of general relativity at the post-Newtonian level have reached high precision, including the light deflection, the Shapiro time delay, the perihelion advance of Mercury, the Nordtvedt effect in lunar motion, and frame-dragging. Gravitational wave damping has been detected in an amount that agrees with general relativity to better than half a percent using the Hulse–Taylor binary pulsar, and a growing family of other binary pulsar systems is yielding new tests, especially of strong-field effects. Current and future tests of relativity will center on strong gravity and gravitational waves.},

It maps the nodes of a dataﬂow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, generalpurpose GPUs, and custom designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives ﬂexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous “parameter server” designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with particularly strong support for training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataﬂow model in contrast to existing systems, and demonstrate the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.},

Apart from possible surprises, there appeared to be three alternatives, which it was especially desired to discriminate between— (1) The path is uninfluenced by gravitation. (2) The energy or mass of light is subject to gravitation in the same way as ordinary matter. If the law of gravitation is strictly the Newtonian law, this leads to an apparent displacement of a star close to the sun’s limb amounting to 0"·87 outwards. (3) The course of a, ray of light is in accordance with Einstein’s generalised relativity theory. This leads to an apparent displacement of a star at the limb amounting to 1"·75 outwards. In either of the last two cases the displacement is inversely proportional to the distance of the star from the sun’s centre, the displacement under (3) being just double the displacement under (2).},

	abstract = {Gravitational lens models for observed lensing systems are often based on quasi-elliptical lenses. The use of elliptical mass distributions is motivated by observations of galaxies and by the assumption that mass follows light. Elliptical mass distributions are also expected on theoretical grounds. On the other hand, since elliptical matter distributions are in general more difficult to handle, quasi-elliptical lens models, in which the isopotential curves are ellipses or in which an external shear component is added onto a spherical deflector, are often used for model fitting or for statistical lens studies. However, elliptical potentials correspond to unphysical matter distributions if the ellipticity is large. In this paper we derive explicit lens equations for a special type of elliptical matter distributions, the `isothermal' ellipsoids. Their matter distribution forms a natural generalization of isothermal spheres, one of the most commonly used models in lens theory. We consider the singular and the non-singular case. For both, the deflection angle is derived in closed form, and it is particularly simple for the singular case. The lens equation in the singular case can be reduced to a one-dimensional equation, making its solution particularly easy. We derive the critical curves and caustics of these isothermal elliptical lens models and obtain a complete classification of the topologies of the critical curves and the caustics. Cross sections for multiple imaging are derived. Especially the singular isothermal ellipsoid provides a very convenient lens model, which is not much more complicated to handle than quasi-elliptical models, and we expect that the explicit equations derived here will be useful for future work.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has seen tremendous success over the past decade in computer vision, machine translation, and gameplay. This success rests crucially on gradient-descent optimization and the ability to “learn” parameters of a neural network by backpropagating observed errors. However, neural network architectures are growing increasingly sophisticated and diverse, which motivates an emerging quest for even more general forms of differentiable programming, where arbitrary parameterized computations can be trained by gradient descent. In this paper, we take a fresh look at automatic differentiation (AD) techniques, and especially aim to demystify the reverse-mode form of AD that generalizes backpropagation in neural networks. We uncover a tight connection between reverse-mode AD and delimited continuations, which permits implementing reverse-mode AD purely via operator overloading and without managing any auxiliary data structures. We further show how this formulation of AD can be fruitfully combined with multi-stage programming (staging), leading to an efficient implementation that combines the performance benefits of deep learning frameworks based on explicit reified computation graphs (e.g., TensorFlow) with the expressiveness of pure library approaches (e.g., PyTorch).

Automatic diﬀerentiation (AD), also called algorithmic diﬀerentiation or simply “autodiﬀ”, is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for eﬃciently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established ﬁeld with applications in areas including computational ﬂuid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the ﬁelds of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other’s results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names “dynamic computational graphs” and “diﬀerentiable programming”. We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely deﬁning the main diﬀerentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms “autodiﬀ”, “automatic diﬀerentiation”, and “symbolic diﬀerentiation” as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

Automatic differentiation (AD) is a powerful tool to automate the calculation of derivatives and is preferable to more traditional methods, especially when differentiating complex algorithms and mathematical functions. The implementation of AD, however, requires some care to insure efficiency. Modern differentiation packages deploy a broad range of computational techniques to improve applicability, run time, and memory management. Among these techniques are operation overloading, region‐based memory, and expression templates. There also exist several mathematical techniques which can yield high performance gains when applied to complex algorithms. For example, semi‐analytical derivatives can reduce by orders of magnitude the runtime required to numerically solve and differentiate an algebraic equation. Open and practical problems include the extension of current packages to provide more specialized routines, and finding optimal methods to perform higher‐order differentiation.
