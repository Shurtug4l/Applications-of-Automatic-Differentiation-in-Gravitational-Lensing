# Applications of Automatic Differentiation in Gravitational Lensing
Simone La Porta's Master thesis in gravitational lensing @ Alma Mater Studiorum - Università di Bologna with applications of automatic differentiation
* Fit of microlensing light curve;
* Strong lens (SIE) reconstruction from multiple images positions;
* Fit of Sérsic surface brightness profile to infer galaxy shapes/ellipticities and measure weak lensing.
