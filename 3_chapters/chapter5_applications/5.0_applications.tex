In the following sections, we discuss specific lensing applications on three different scales.
Our discussion initiates with a detailed examination of microlensing events, phenomena where the gravitational field of a relatively small object, such as a star or planet, magnifies the light of a background star. This section will focus on the technique of light-curve fitting, a method that analyzes the temporal change in brightness of the lensed star to extract critical information about the lensing object. Microlensing offers a unique method for detecting elusive objects, including exoplanets \citep{sumi_unbound_2011,gaudi_microlensing_2012} and dark compact objects, providing insights into the mass, motion, and distribution of such entities within the Milky Way \citep{alcock_possible_1993,udalski_optical_1993}.

Transitioning from the stellar to the galactic scale, we next explore the realm of galaxy-scale lensing \citep{treu_strong_2010} by optimizing a parametric strong lensing model. This segment emphasizes the development and optimization of parametric models for strong lensing, where entire galaxies act as lenses, distorting and magnifying the light of more distant galaxies into arcs and rings. Through the optimization of these models, we aim to reconstruct the mass distribution of lensing galaxies \citep{auger_sloan_2010}, including the elusive dark matter component \citep{vegetti_detection_2010}. This approach not only sheds light on the structure and composition of galaxies, but also contributes to our understanding of the evolution of the large-scale structure of the Universe.

Finally, we will address weak lensing by fitting surface brightness profiles and measuring ellipticities.
