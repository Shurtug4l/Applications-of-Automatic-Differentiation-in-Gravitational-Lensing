This chapter delves into the intricate process of lens modeling, a pivotal technique for interpreting gravitational lensing observations. Gravitational lens models can be separated into two main categories: point-mass lenses (\ie \emph{microlenses}) and extended lenses, each possessing distinctive characteristics.
Microlensing refers to the lensing effect caused by objects with relatively small masses, such as stars or planets, acting as lenses. Unlike their more massive counterparts, microlenses do not produce multiple discernible images of the background source. Instead, they induce magnification variations over time as the lens moves relative to the observer and the source. 
Transitioning to a grander scale, extended lenses involve massive structures like galaxies and galaxy clusters, capable of producing multiple, resolvable images of background sources.
