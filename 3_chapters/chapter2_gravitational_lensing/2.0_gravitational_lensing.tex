In the realm of astrophysics and gravitational theory, the concept that gravity affects not only matter but also light has a long history, dating back to Newton's \emph{Opticks} \citep{newton_opticks_1704}.
The initial calculation of the Newtonian deflection of light rays passing near massive bodies was undertaken by Cavendish in 1784, and von Soldner subsequently published these findings in 1804 \citep{will_henry_1988,will_confrontation_2014}. It was Albert Einstein himself who, in 1915, as he completed his General Theory of Relativity \citep{einstein_feldgleichungen_1915}, recognized that the Newtonian prediction of light-ray deflection near the Sun was only half the value foreseen by his revolutionary theory. The confirmation of this twice as large deflection during the solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, observed by Eddington \citep{dyson_ix_1920,will_1919_2015}, marked a momentous confirmation of this nascent theory and captivated global attention. Not only did this observation represent the first in a series of triumphs for general relativity, but it also inaugurated the practical application of \emph{gravitational lensing}, a method that would later become a cornerstone of observational astrophysics.

More than a century has passed since that pivotal moment, and gravitational lensing has evolved into a well-established and respected tool within the fields of astronomy and astrophysics. Presently, the study of lensing theory and its applications can be broadly categorized into three distinct components \citep{kochanek_saas_2004}: \emph{strong} lensing, characterized by non-linear deflection at the scale of galaxies and galaxy clusters, produces distinct phenomena such as multiple images, arcs, and rings, \emph{weak} lensing, observed on both cluster and cosmological scales, is a subtle linear effect that gently aligns background galaxies with intervening matter. Statistical analysis of the observed distribution of light allows for the extraction of information regarding the distribution of intervening matter. Finally, \emph{microlensing} involves the dynamic fluctuation of light when compact objects pass in front of background sources at scales too minute to be resolved.
